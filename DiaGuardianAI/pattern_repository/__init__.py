"""Module for managing a repository of treatment patterns in DiaGuardianAI.

This package is responsible for the storage, retrieval, and management of
"successful" or noteworthy treatment patterns. These patterns can be learned
by agents during simulation or predefined, and can include specific parameters,
state-action sequences, or generalized policies. The goal is to leverage this
repository to improve agent decision-making and provide insights.

Key Contents:
    - `RepositoryManager`: A class to handle database interactions, pattern
      storage (potentially with embeddings for similarity search), retrieval
      of relevant patterns, and updating pattern effectiveness.
