"""Examples module for the DiaGuardianAI library.

This package contains various example scripts and notebooks demonstrating how to
use the different components of the DiaGuardianAI library. These examples
are intended to help users understand the library's capabilities and provide
starting points for their own research and simulations.

The examples might cover:
    - Generating synthetic patient data.
    - Training and evaluating predictive glucose models.
    - Setting up and running closed-loop simulations with RL agents.
    - Utilizing the pattern repository.
    - Demonstrating the use of utility functions.

Each script should be self-contained or clearly indicate its dependencies
and how to run it.
