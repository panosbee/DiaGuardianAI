"""Test suite for the DiaGuardianAI library.

This package contains all the unit tests, integration tests, and potentially
other test types for the DiaGuardianAI library. The structure of this test
package mirrors the structure of the main `DiaGuardianAI` library.

Tests are organized into submodules corresponding to the modules in the
`DiaGuardianAI` package (e.g., `tests.core` for `DiaGuardianAI.core`).

The `pytest` framework is used for test discovery and execution.
