## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install diaguardianai
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from DiaGuardianAI.sdk import DiabetesManager

# Initialize the ONE IN A BILLION diabetes management system
dm = DiabetesManager()

# Add a patient with clinical parameters
patient_id = dm.add_patient(
    diabetes_type="type_1",
    age=35,
    weight_kg=70,
    isf=50,  # Insulin sensitivity factor (mg/dL per unit)
    cr=10,   # Carbohydrate ratio (grams per unit)  
    basal_rate=1.2  # Basal insulin rate (units per hour)
)

# Get intelligent insulin recommendation
recommendation = dm.get_insulin_recommendation(
    patient_id=patient_id,
    current_glucose=120,  # Current glucose reading (mg/dL)
    meal_carbs=45,        # Carbohydrates being consumed (grams)
    current_iob=1.5       # Current insulin on board (units)
)

# Professional output with safety validation
print(f"Recommended Bolus: {recommendation.bolus_amount_u:.1f} units")
print(f"Recommended Basal: {recommendation.basal_rate_u_hr:.2f} U/hr")
print(f"Safety Level: {recommendation.safety_level.value}")
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# Real-time glucose monitoring
glucose_alert = dm.add_glucose_reading(
    patient_id=patient_id,
    glucose_mg_dl=85,  # Trending low
    source="cgm"
)

# Performance analytics
metrics = dm.get_performance_metrics(
    patient_id=patient_id,
    days=7  # Last 7 days analysis
)

print(f"ONE IN A BILLION Status: {metrics.one_in_billion_achieved}")
print(f"TIR 80-130: {metrics.tir_80_130_percent:.1f}%")
```

## Clinical Integration

### Healthcare Provider Interface
```python
# Clinical decision support integration
def clinical_workflow(patient_id, glucose_reading, meal_info):
    recommendation = dm.get_insulin_recommendation(
        patient_id=patient_id,
        current_glucose=glucose_reading,
        meal_carbs=meal_info.get("carbs", 0)
    )
    
    # Safety validation for clinical use
    if recommendation.safety_level in ["warning", "critical"]:
        send_clinical_alert(patient_id, recommendation)
    
    return recommendation
```

### Medical Device Integration
